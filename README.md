Linear Regression to Forecast Canada's Per Capita Income
Objective: This project is centered on forecasting Canada's per capita income for upcoming years through the utilization of a straightforward linear regression model.

Methodology: We employ linear regression to establish a mathematical relationship between the year (considered as the independent variable) and per capita income (treated as the dependent variable). The primary goal of this model is to determine the most suitable linear equation that characterizes this connection.

Data Source: Our predictions are grounded in historical data retrieved from the 'canada_per_capita_income.csv' dataset.

Implementation: The project is executed using Python for coding the linear regression model. The detailed code and its execution are documented in the accompanying Jupyter Notebook.

Application: You can make use of this model to make predictions about Canada's per capita income for any desired future year, which can be valuable for economic analysis and forecasting.

Illustrations: Enclosed within the folder, you will discover a CSV file containing entries spanning from 2020 to 2040, along with the projected prices generated by the model.
